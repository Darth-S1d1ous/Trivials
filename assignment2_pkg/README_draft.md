The assignment2_pkg contains submissions to two questions given in tutorial 2: Introduction to ROS.
- reader.py and sum.py are the submissions to question 1. To launch them, use `roslaunch assignment2_pkg question1.launch`
- ...py are the submissions to question 2. To launch them:
  - use `roslaunch assignment2_pkg question2.launch`, and the 2D coordinates will be saved to the points.txt file
  - need to set the environment variable TURTLEBOT3_WORLD before launching the launch file. (e.g. `export TURTLEBOT3_WORLD=burger`)
